Public Class Form1

    'Imagine your computer as a massive warehouse, and all the data in your computer as boxes within the warehouse.
    'A variable is a box within your warehouse.
    'Now, each of your boxes has its own identifying name, like a package ID.
    'Each box can hold something (duh), but you should be sure to specify what you want them to hold.

    'Here, we create a new box in your warehouse.
    'The box is named: decValue
    'We specify that we want it to hold Decimal values.
    'We then use the assignment operator to put a decimal value inside of it.
    Dim decValue As Decimal = 12.3

    'Cool, so now we have a box in our warehouse named decValue that holds decimals
    'It also now happens to be holding the value 12.3

    Private Sub btnShowValues_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnShowValues.Click

        'Now, it holds 12.3, so that's cool. But say we want to display that value in dollar format.
        'So, we want to display the value like this: 12.30
        'This is a little complex. We'll use the ToString way.
        'What the following does, is it takes the value in decValue and fits it to the format in the parentheses.
        'Basically, it takes 12.3, and reformats it as such:
        'It puts a dollar sign first, then the number, but only up to 2 decimal points.
        'Then it takes this new value and puts it into our decValue box, replacing our old unformatted decimal with our new formatted string.
        decValue = decValue.ToString("0.00")

        'Quick note- decValue is now a STRING, hence the thing being named "ToString"

        'Now I display it in a label (first adding a dollar sign in front), and bam.
        lblDollarValue.Text = "$" & decValue

        'Note 2- If Mr. Lockamy gets mad at you for using concatenation (fancy word for the & symbol) tell him I told you to do it so he can get mad at me :p
        'I'll be in his room at Lunch again tomorrow so if you need help either Karl and I got ya.
